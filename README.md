# ControlStatus

A **MyHDL** project to create Control and Status Registers

_*Caveat Programmer*_

This code is _experimental_ and _unfinished_ and thus bound to change over time.
It does simulate.
But doesn't convert without the patch described in _closed_ [PullRequest #1](https://github.com/jandecaluwe/myhdl/pull/1).
Even with the _patch_ the VHDL conversion is not error-free (yet)
