# ControlStatus

A **MyHDL** project to create Control and Status Registers

Update June 6th, 2015:

    MyHDL now supports constants in ConcatSignal().

    The undocumented toVHDL.numeric\_ports feature has been replaced by the toVHDL.std\_logic\_ports and now the conversion to VHDL is consistently error-free.
